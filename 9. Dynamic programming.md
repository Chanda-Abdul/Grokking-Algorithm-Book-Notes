# Chapter 9. Dynamic programming

- <b>dynamic programming</b>, a technique to solve a hard problem by breaking it up into subproblems and solving those subproblems first.

-  Dynamic programming only works when each subproblem is discrete—when it doesn’t depend on other subproblems. 

- Dynamic programming is useful when you’re trying to optimize something given a constraint. 

- The Feynman algorithm is named after the famous physicist Richard Feynman, and it works like this:
  - Write down the problem.
  - Think real hard.
  - Write down the solution.

## Recap
- Dynamic programming is useful when you’re trying to optimize something given a constraint.
- You can use dynamic programming when the problem can be broken into discrete subproblems.
- Every dynamic-programming solution involves a grid.
- The values in the cells are usually what you’re trying to optimize.
- Each cell is a subproblem, so think about how you can divide your problem into subproblems.
- There’s no single formula for calculating a dynamic-programming solution.

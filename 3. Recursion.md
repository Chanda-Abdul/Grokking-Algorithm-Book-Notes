# Chapter 3 - Recursion 

"Loops may acheive a performance gain for your program. Recursion may acheive a performance gain for your programmer.  Choose which is more important in your situation."
- Recursion is when a function calls itself
  - base case => when the function doesnt call itself, prevents infinite loop
  - recursive case => when the function calls itself
- a stack has two operations `.push()` and `.pop()`
- All function calls go onto the call stack
- the call stack can get very large which can take up a lot of memory.


## Time Compelexity

O(n) or linear for recurisve functions

# Chapter 6. Breadth-first search 

- <b>Breadth-first search</b> allows you to find the search distance between two points

- shortest path problems are solved with Breadth-first search
  - moodel the problem as a graph
  - solve the problem using Breadth-first search 

- A <b>graph</b> models a set of connections which are made of nodes and edges
- Breadth-first search is a type of algorithm that runs on graphs
  - is there a path?
  - what is the shortest path?

- a <b>queue</b> is a type of data structure for BFS.
  - enqueue to add or `.push()`
  - dequeue to remove or `.pop()`
- hash tables
- directed graphs(one way)

## Time complexity

- Breadth-first search has a run time of `O(V + E)` where V is Verticies and E is Edges
- Topological sort

## Recap
- Breadth-first search tells you if there’s a path from A to B.
- If there’s a path, breadth-first search will find the shortest path.
- If you have a problem like “find the shortest X,” try modeling your problem as a graph, and use breadth-first search to solve.
- A directed graph has arrows, and the relationship follows the direction of the arrow (rama -> adit means “rama owes adit money”).
- Undirected graphs don’t have arrows, and the relationship goes both ways (ross - rachel means “ross dated rachel and rachel dated ross”).
- Queues are FIFO (First In, First Out).
- Stacks are LIFO (Last In, First Out).
- You need to check people in the order they were added to the search list, so the search list needs to be a queue. Otherwise, you won’t get the shortest path.
- Once you check someone, make sure you don’t check them again. Otherwise, you might end up in an infinite loop.

## Implementation in JavaScript
````
const bfs = (node) => { 
   visited[node] = true;
   queue.equeue(node); 
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        let visiting = queue.dequeue();
        console.log(`we visited ${visiting}`)
        for (let j = 0; j < graphAdj[visiting].length; j++) {
           if ((graphAdj[visiting][j] === 1) && (visited[j] === false)) {  
           visited[j] = true;
           queue.equeue(j);
          }
       }
     }
}

Traversal
````
function traverseBFS(root) {
  let queue = [root]
  let res = []
  
  while (queue.length) {      
    let curr = queue.shift()
    res.push(curr.key)
    
    if (curr.right){
      queue.push(curr.right)
    }
    
    if (curr.left){
      queue.push(curr.left)
    }
  }
  
  return res
}

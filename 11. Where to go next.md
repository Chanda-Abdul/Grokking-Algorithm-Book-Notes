## Binary search tree 
- Searching for an element in a binary search tree takes O(log n) time on average and O(n) time in the worst case. 
- Searching a sorted array takes O(log n) time in the worst case, so you might think a sorted array is better. But a binary search tree is a lot faster for insertions and deletions on average.
 
 |   | Array| Search Tree|
|---|---|---|
|Search|O(log n)|O(log n)|
|Insert|O(n)|O(log n)|
|Delete|O(n)|O(log n)|

- Binary search trees have some downsides too: for one thing, you don’t get random access. You can’t say, “Give me the fifth element of this tree.” Those performance times are also on average and rely on the tree being balanced.
- If you’re interested in databases or more-advanced data structures, check these out:
  - B-trees
  - Red-black trees
  - Heaps
  - Splay trees
  
## Inverted indexes
- a hash that maps words to places where they appear. This data structure is called an inverted index, and it’s commonly used to build search engines.

## The Fourier transform

The Fourier transform is one of those rare algorithms: brilliant, elegant, and with a million use cases. The best analogy for the Fourier transform comes from Better Explained (a great website that explains math simply): given a smoothie, the Fourier transform will tell you the ingredients in the smoothie.[1] Or, to put it another way, given a song, the transform can separate it into individual frequencies.

## Parallel algorithms

- To make your algorithms faster, you need to change them to run in parallel across all the cores at once!

- It’s well known that you can’t sort an array in O(n) time—unless you use a parallel algorithm! There’s a parallel version of quicksort that will sort an array in O(n) time.

- Parallel algorithms are hard to design. And it’s also hard to make sure they work correctly and to figure out what type of speed boost you’ll see. 

- Overhead of managing the parallelism

- Load balancing

- If you’re interested in the theoretical side of performance and scalability, parallel algorithms might be for you!

## MapReduce

- There’s a special type of parallel algorithm that is becoming increasingly popular: the distributed algorithm. 
- The MapReduce algorithm is a popular distributed algorithm. You can use it through the popular open source tool Apache Hadoop.
- Distributed algorithms are great when you have a lot of work to do and want to speed up the time required to do it. MapReduce in particular is built up from two simple ideas: the `map` function and the `reduce` function
  - The `map` function is simple: it takes an array and applies the same function to each item in the array.
  - With `reduce`, you transform an array to a single item.
  
## Bloom filters and HyperLogLog

- Bloom filters offer a solution. Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures. They give you an answer that could be wrong but is probably correct. Instead of a hash, you can ask your bloom filter if you’ve crawled this URL before. A hash table would give you an accurate answer
- Bloom filters are great because they take up very little space. A hash table would have to store every URL crawled by Google, but a bloom filter doesn’t have to do that. They’re great when you don’t need an exact answer, as in all of these examples. It’s okay for bit.ly to say, “We think this site might be malicious, so be extra careful.”
- HyperLogLog approximates the number of unique elements in a set. Just like bloom filters, it won’t give you an exact answer, but it comes very close and uses only a fraction of the memory a task like this would otherwise take.

## The SHA algorithms

- Another hash function is a secure hash algorithm (SHA) function. Given a string, SHA gives you a hash for that string.
- SHA is a hash function. It generates a hash, which is just a short string. The hash function for hash tables went from string to array index, whereas SHA goes from string to string.
- SHA generates a different hash for every string.
- SHA is also useful when you want to compare strings without revealing what the original string was. 
- You can convert a password to a hash, but not vice versa.
- If you make a small change to a string, Simhash generates a hash that’s only a little different. This allows you to compare hashes and see how similar two strings are

## Diffie-Hellman key exchange

- Diffie-Hellman has two keys: a public key and a private key. 
  - The public key is exactly that: public. You can post it on your website, email it to friends, or do anything you want with it. You don’t have to hide it. When someone wants to send you a message, they encrypt it using the public key. 
  - An encrypted message can only be decrypted using the private key. As long as you’re the only person with the private key, only you will be able to decrypt this message
  
## Linear programming

- Linear programming is used to maximize something given some constraints. 
  - For example, suppose your company makes two products, shirts and totes. 
    - Shirts need 1 meter of fabric and 5 buttons. 
    - Totes need 2 meters of fabric and 2 buttons. 
    - You have 11 meters of fabric and 20 buttons. 
    - You make $2 per shirt and $3 per tote. 
    - How many shirts and totes should you make to maximize your profit?
- Linear programming uses the Simplex algorithm.

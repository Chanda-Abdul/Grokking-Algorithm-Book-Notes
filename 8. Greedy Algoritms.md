# Chapter 8. Greedy Algoritms

- A greedy algorithm is simple: at each step, pick the optimal move.

- In technical terms: at each step you pick the locally optimal solution, and in the end you’re left with the globally optimal solution.

- power set
  - Sets are like lists, except sets can’t have duplicates.
  - You can do some interesting operations on sets, like union, intersection, and difference.

- approximation algorithm

- factorial function 

- NP-complete
  - Your algorithm runs quickly with a handful of items but really slows down with more items.
  - “All combinations of X” usually point to an NP-complete problem.
 -  Do you have to calculate “every possible version” of X because you can’t break it down into smaller sub-problems? Might be NP-complete.
  - If your problem involves a sequence (such as a sequence of cities, like traveling salesperson), and it’s hard to solve, it might be NP-complete.
  - If your problem involves a set (like a set of radio stations) and it’s hard to solve, it might be NP-complete.
  - Can you restate your problem as the set-covering problem or the traveling-salesperson problem? Then your problem is definitely NP-complete.
  
## Recap
- Greedy algorithms optimize locally, hoping to end up with a global optimum.
- NP-complete problems have no known fast solution.
- If you have an NP-complete problem, your best bet is to use an approximation algorithm.
- Greedy algorithms are easy to write and fast to run, so they make good approximation algorithms.
